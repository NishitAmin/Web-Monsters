        jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

    <!--Some Main Concepts  -->
    <a id="concepts"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Concepts</span>
    <ol>
        <li><span class="listTitle">Selectors in jQuery</span>
            <p class="contentData">A jQuery Selector is a function which makes use of expressions to find out matching elements from a DOM based on the given criteria. Simply you can say, selectors are used to select one or more HTML elements using jQuery. Once an element is selected then we can perform various operations on that selected element. Selector syntax can be very simple statements that return single elements to more complicated statements that select and filter numerous elements according to areas such as their type, attributes, CSS classes, and other aspect. 
                By unique ID:$("#uniqueIDName").action();
                By tag name:$("p").action();
                By class name:$(".exampleClass").action();
                <br>

        <li><span class="listTitle">jQuery Traversing</span>
            <p class="contentData">
                jQuery traversing, which means "move through", are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements. Start with one selection and move through that selection until you reach the elements you desire.
                The image below illustrates an HTML page as a tree (DOM tree). With jQuery traversing, you can easily move up (ancestors), down (descendants) and sideways (siblings) in the tree, starting from the selected (current) element. This movement is called traversing - or moving through - the DOM tree.

    <!-- ADVANTAGES SECTION -->
    <a id="adv"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Advantages</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        Basically you can do almost anything with jQuery to make effects
        and animation on your site and still be SEO friendly and cross browser
        compliant. But those aren’t the only benefits….“jQuery is a fast and
        concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing,
        event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
        jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.”</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">Search Engine Optimized:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
       <p class="contentData">While search engines are getting better at being able
           to read content within some Flash, everything within jQuery is setup as text.
           This means it is completely readable to all the search engines, exposing all
           your keyword rich content.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Save Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">Five lines of jQuery are equivalent to 25
            lines of conventional JavaScript code. This means smaller files
            and faster loading web pages.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Plug-ins:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">There are an abundance of plug-ins on the
            web that make creating special effects simple and fast for web
            developers.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Help?:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">With an abundance of plug-ins comes with
            an abundance of help. There is a large helpful support community
            on the web to help you quickly remedy any bug issues.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Cross Browser Friendly:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">jQuery is currently the most popular JavaScript library and works in all browsers.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Mobile Devices:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">jQuery is supported by any mobile device whose
            web browser supports JavaScript. A lot of mobile devices like iPads
            and iPhones don’t run Flash at all.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Wow Factor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
       <p class="contentData">Web developers use jQuery to make web
           pages more exciting, interactive, cleaner, and more user
           friendly. Make your users go WOW!</p>

    <!--Disadvantage section-->
    <a id="disadv"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Disadvantage</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        One of the main disadvantages of jQuery is a large number of published
        versions in the short time. This means that if you are running the latest
        version of jQuery, you will have to host the library yourself and update it constantly.</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">Increased techology stack:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
       <p class="contentData">When you add a framework or toolbox to any project,
           you should always stop and think if it is *worth* it. You will add a dependency
           and future developers will need to understand it to maintain it. jQuery is going
           to be around for a long time, but forever? I don't think so.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Slow down:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">It also (when used) slows the operation of some
            tasks - one could/can argue that some tasks are done fast (and reliable)
            in jQuery compared to a naive plain javascript implementation.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Bandwitth:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">It takes up a (small) amount of bandwith to
            download for the client/user of your website.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Better alternatives:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">There are many other frameworks out there,
            that doesn't require jQuery and if you're already using one of
            these, adding jQuery might be an anti-pattern or just adding extra
            complexity that wasn't needed.</p>
    </ul>
    <!----------------------->

    <!--Usage section-->
    <a id="usage"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Usage</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        jQuery’s API is well designed. Its functionality is so
        complete that the last few major releases of the library
        have hardly added any new methods at all. JQuery plays extremely well
        with other code. It doesn’t extend any built-in JavaScript objects and
        only adds one symbol to the global namespace. Some of the main uses of
        jQuery explained in detail are as below:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">Develop Ajax based applications:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">jQuery is used to easily write client-side JavaScript
            to navigate and manipulate a page and make asynchronous Ajax callbacks.
            By using jQuery and JSON Web Services, Ajax callbacks have become standard
            programming practices for designing and developing web applications.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Easy integration with Visual Studio IDE:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">The Visual Studio provides with extensions which help in
            integration of jQuery libraries into.Net framework projects. This integration
            of JQuery libraries into.Net framework is supported by the Visual Studio 2010 version.
            The NuGet package extension of visual studio helps in this integration. With help of this
            integration visual studio’s IntelliSense feature is switched on. This feature all the
            jQuery methods are auto-populated and errors are displayed where the syntax is wrong.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">jQuery makes flash like animated applications:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">It takes time to learn Flash and years of experience to make
            animations in Flash, hence hiring Flash developers is not a cheap task. With
            uses of jQuery, you only need knowledge of JavaScript and HTML to make animations.
            Also, there are tons of plugins which make this task even simpler.</p>
