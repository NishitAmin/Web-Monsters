    <p class="contentData">
        XML is extensible: It lets you define your own tags, the order in which they occur, and how they should be processed or displayed. Another way to think about extensibility is to consider that XML allows all of us to extend our notion of what a document is: it can be a file that lives on a file server, or it can be a transient piece of data that flows between two computer systems (as in the case of Web Services).
        Markup: The most recognizable feature of XML is its tags, or elements (to be more accurate). In fact, the elements you’ll create in XML will be very similar to the elements you’ve already been creating in your HTML documents. However, XML allows you to define your own set of tags.
        Language: Report Advertisement XML is a language that’s very similar to HTML. It’s much more flexible than HTML because it allows you to create your own custom tags. However, it’s important to realize that XML is not just a language. XML is a meta-language: a language that allows us to create or define other languages. For example, with XML we can create other languages, such as RSS, MathML (a mathematical markup language), and even tools like XSLT.

        <li><span class="listTitle">XMLHttpRequest</span>
            <p class="contentData">The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server. The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream, because you can Update a web page without reloading the page. Request data from a server - after the page has loaded. Receive data from a server after the page has loaded and sending data to a server in the background

            <p class="contentData">
                XML documents are formed as element trees. An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements. All elements can have sub elements (child elements):

    <!-- ADVANTAGES SECTION -->
    <a id="adv"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Advantages</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        Using XML to exchange information offers many benefits.
        XML uses human, not computer, language. XML is readable
        and understandable, even by novices, and no more difficult to code than HTML.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">XML separates data from HTML:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">If you need to display dynamic data in your HTML document, it will take a
    lot of work to edit the HTML each time the data changes. With XML, data can be stored
    in separate XML files. This way you can focus on using HTML/CSS for display and layout,
    and be sure that changes in the underlying data will not require any changes to the HTML.
    With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an external XML file and update the data
    content of your web page.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">XML simplifies data sharing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">In the real world, computer systems and databases contain data in incompatible
            formats. XML data is stored in plain text format. This provides a software- and
            hardware-independent way of storing data. This makes it much easier to create data
            that can be shared by different applications.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">XML simplifies data transport:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">One of the most time-consuming challenges for developers is to exchange
            data between incompatible systems over the Internet. Exchanging data as
            XML greatly reduces this complexity, since the data can be read by different
            incompatible applications.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">XML simplifies Platform change:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">Upgrading to new systems (hardware or software platforms), is always time
            consuming. Large amounts of data must be converted and incompatible data is
            often lost. XML data is stored in text format. This makes it easier to expand
            or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without
            losing data.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">XML increases data availability:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">Different applications can access your data, not only in HTML pages,
            but also from XML data sources. With XML, your data can be available
            to all kinds of "reading machines" (Handheld computers, voice machines,
            news feeds, etc), and make it more available for blind people, or people
            with other disabilities.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">XML can be used to create new internet languages:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">A lot of new Internet languages are created with XML. Here are some examples:
        XHTML, WSDL for describing available web services, WAP and WML as markup languages
    for handheld devices, RSS languages for news feeds, RDF and OWL for describing resources
            and ontology, SMIL for describing multimedia for the web.</p>

    </ul>

    <!--Disadvantage section-->
    <a id="disadv"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Disadvantage</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        XML document is less readable compared to other text-based data transmission formats such as JSON.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">Lack of Applications Processing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML needs an application processing system .
            There are no browsers yet which can read XML.
            In the case of HTML, anyone can write up a program and that
            can be read using any browser anywhere in the world. To be
            able to be read in a browser, XML still depends on HTML, and is not independent of it.
            The XML documents have to be converted to HTML before they are deployed.
        </p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">General Weaknesses of XML:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">Since XML is a verbose language, it is totally
            dependant on who is writing it. A verbose language may pose problems
            for other users. XML is not specific to any platform, and has a neutral
            platform requirement which may be a disadvantage in a few circumstances.
            All the standards of XML are not yet fully compliant. They are not fully
            recognized to be used yet. Users have reported problems with the parser and
            there are problems with XML and HTTP which are still being resolved.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Disadvantages for XML Documents:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML documents can be difficult and also expensive to setup.
            A freelancer for example can sit at his home and at his own pace create,
            write and format a document or a manuscript using any of the free software
            available. However, the moment he introduces XML or starts with it, the whole
            process could get really painful to take the document further.</p>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <!----------------------->

    <!--Usage section-->
    <a id="usage"></a>
    <span class="contentHeader">Usage</span>
    <p class="contentData">
        XML has a variety of uses for Web, e-business, and portable applications.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li><span class="listTitle">Web publishing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML allows you to create interactive pages,
            allows the customer to customize those pages, and makes creating
            e-commerce applications more intuitive. With XML, you store the data
            once and then render that content for different viewers or devices based
            on style sheet processing using an Extensible Style Language (XSL)/XSL
            Transformation (XSLT) processor.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Web searching and automating Web tasks:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML defines the type of information contained in a document,
            making it easier to return useful results when searching the Web: For example,
            using HTML to search for books authored by Tom Brown is likely to return instances
            of the term 'brown' outside of the context of author. Using XML restricts the search
            to the correct context (for example, the information contained in the &lt;anchor&gt; tag)
                and returns only the information that you want. By using XML, Web agents and
                robots (programs that automate Web searches or other tasks) are more efficient and
                produce more useful results.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">General applications:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML provides a standard method to access information,
            making it easier for applications and devices of all kinds to use, store,
            transmit, and display data.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">e-business applications:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML implementations make electronic data interchange
            (EDI) more accessible for information interchange, business-to-business
            transactions, and business-to-consumer transactions.</p>

        <li><span class="listTitle">Pervasive computing:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
        <p class="contentData">XML provides portable and structured information
            types for display on pervasive (wireless) computing devices such as
            personal digital assistants (PDAs), cellular phones, and others.
            For example, WML (Wireless Markup Language) and VoiceXML are currently
            evolving standards for describing visual and speech-driven wireless device interfaces.</p>
